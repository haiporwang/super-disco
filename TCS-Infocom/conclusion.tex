In this paper, we formulate the coflow and circuits scheduling (COCIS)problem and prove it's NP-hardness. What's more, we prove it's two subproblems, coflow scheduling (COS) and circuits scheduling (CIS), are NP-hard too. To solve these two subproblems, we propose the corresponding approximation algorithms with analyzed approximation ratio. Later in our simulation, we show that our proposed GROD+CIS algorithm can reduce the CCT by 40\%-80\%.
