Optical Circuit Switches (OCS) are increasingly used in cluster networks due to their data rate, energy and longevity advantages over electrical packet switches. Concurrently, an emerging crucial requirement for modern data-parallel clusters is to achieve high application-level communication efficiency when servicing structured traffic flows (a.k.a. Coflows) from distributed data processing applications. Only completing all flows in a coflow is meaningful to an application. To optimize application performance, both traffic scheduling and switch scheduling must be jointly considered at the level of a coflow rather than individual flows. However, prior solutions have significant limitation: they only consider traffic scheduling in the traditional network, or consider the switch scheduling for only one switch, which are both insufficient. To this end, we present TSS, a coflow-aware network optimization framework that seamlessly integrates traffic and switch scheduling for better application performance. Using a large-scale simulations, we demonstrate that TSS significantly reduces the average coflow completion time (CCT) by up to 66.3\% compared to the state-of-the-art scheduling-only solution.
